## Description

### What is Whack-a-Mole?

#### A certain number of holes in the play area top are filled with small, plastic, cartoonish moles, which pop up at random. Points are scored by whacking each mole as it appears.

### Setup

#### There will be a grid filled with hole sprites. When a mole pops up the hole sprite will be replaced with the mole. Each time a user hits a mole the users score will go up; Depending on how fast the user hits the mole the score will be different.

#### When the game is done the users score will be recorded. If the user gets a new high score the current high score will be repalced with the new score. There will also ne a reset button to reset both current score and high score.
